Hello! I'm a nineth grade economics student at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP) and, very recently, an specialist in the Department of Economic Activity Indicators at Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP). Before that, I performed as a pre professional practitioner at APOYO Consultoría for five months. My interest fields are macroeconomics, time series econometrics, statistics and finance. 

## Curso de Extensión en Economía Avanzada - BCRP

In summer, 2022, I had the unique opportunity to study with the best peruvian economic students at the annual summer course that the Central Bank of Peru organizes. In it, I extended the kwnoledge aquired in undergradute courses, in fields such as Bayesian Statistics, Financial Programming, Neokeynesian model for an open economy,as in Gali & Monacelli (2005), and Monetary Theory. The ultimate goal was to propose a Monetary Policy Action in response to an exogenous shock (stagflation) that propagated into the economy, using an DSGE model in Dynare.
