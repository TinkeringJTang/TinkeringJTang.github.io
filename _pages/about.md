Hello! I'm a nineth grade economics student at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP) and very recently an specialist in the Department of Economic Activity Indicators at Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP). My interest fields are macroeconomics, time series econometrics, statistics and finance. 

## Curso de Extensión en Economía Avanzada - BCRP

In summer, 2022, I had the unique opportunity to study with the best peruvian economic students at the annual summer course that the Central Bank of Peru organizes. In it, I extended the kwnoledge aquired in undergradute courses, in fields such as Bayesian Statistics and the Neokeynesian model for an open economy, as in Gali & Monacelli (2005).
