Hello! I'm a nineth grade economics student at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP) and, very recently, an specialist in the Department of Economic Activity Indicators at Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP). Before that, I performed as a pre professional practitioner at APOYO Consultoría for five months. My interest fields are macroeconomics, time series econometrics, statistics and finance. 

## Curso de Extensión en Economía Avanzada - BCRP

In summer, 2022, I had the unique opportunity to study with the best peruvian economic students at the annual summer course that the Central Bank of Peru organizes. In it, I extended the kwnoledge aquired in undergradute courses, in fields such as Bayesian Statistics, Financial Programming, Neokeynesian model for an open economy,as in Gali & Monacelli (2005), and Monetary Theory. The ultimate goal was to propose a Monetary Policy Action in response to an exogenous shock (stagflation) that propagated into the economy, using an DSGE model in Dynare.

## APOYO Consultoría

I practitioned for five months in the real-sector team, following the evolution of peruvian mining, electricity and public infrastructure sectors, as well as the COVID-19 impact on the economy.

## Causal Inference and Machine Learning

During recent months, I developed skills regarding Machine Learning and Causal Inference, in specific topics, such as:

* Prediction/Inference with High Dimensional Linear Models
* Prediction in Modern Nonlinear Regressions (Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks)
* Randomized Control Trials
* Causal DAGs
* Double/debiased Machine Learning
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Trees
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Forest

## Others

* Experience in coding with Python, R and Julia
* Bilingual in spanish and english
